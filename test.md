In [PR# 13250](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/13250) 	we define modular forms, cusp forms and prove that they form a complex vector space. These are analytic functions of number theoretic interest, due to their links with geometry, representation theory and analysis. Most famously they are a  key ingredient in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. In this post we discuss the formalization process and the main issues that arose.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

Before going any further I should mention that this isn't the first time modular forms have been defined in Lean. Back in 2018, for Kevin Buzzard's birthday several people defined modular forms (amongst other things) [here](https://github.com/semorrison/kbb). Although the current definition looks quite different, it was of great use when I started learning Lean. Moreover I should say the current version benefited immensely from great feedback from many people, including Riccardo Brasca, Kevin Buzzard, David Loeffler, Jireh Loreaux, Heather Macbeth and Eric Wieser.

# Basic definitions



At their most basic, modular forms are functions on the complex upper half plane $\mathbb{H}:=\\{ z \in \mathbb{C} \mid 0 \lt  Im(z)\\}$ to $\mathbb{C}$ satisfying certain properties. Before giving the definition, lets first define an action on this space of functions.

For any 

$$\gamma =
\left(\begin{array}{cc} 
a & b\\ 
c & d
\end{array}\right)
$$

in $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{R})^+$ the weight $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ action of $\gamma$ on $f : \mathbb{H} \to \mathbb{C}$ is given by $$(f \mid_k \gamma) (z):=\mathrm{det} (\gamma)^{k-1} (cz+d)^{-k} f\left ( \frac{az+b}{cz+d}\right ).$$ One easily checks that this defines a right action on this space of functions, known as the weight $k$ *slash action*.

Let  $\Gamma$ denote a subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$, then a modular form  of level $\Gamma$ and weight $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ is a function $f : \mathbb{H} \to \mathbb{C}$ such that:

- (ü•ì) For all $\gamma \in \Gamma$ we have $f\mid_k \gamma = f$. We will call such functions *slash invariant forms*.
- (ü¶ñ) $f$ is holomorphic on $\mathbb{H}$.
- (üê±) For all $\gamma \in \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$, there exist $A, B \in \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $z \in \mathbb{H}$, with $A \le Im(z)$, we have $|(f \mid_k \gamma) (z) |\le B$. Here $| - |$ denotes the standard complex absolute value. We call such functions *bounded at infinity*.

This defines a complex vector space which we denote by $M_{k}(\Gamma)$. By replacing condition (üê±) in the above with (üê∂) below defines the subspace of cusp forms, which we denote by $S_k(\Gamma)$.

- (üê∂)  For all $\gamma \in \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$, and all  $0 < \epsilon$, there exists $A \in \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $z \in \mathbb{H}$, with $A \le \mathrm{Im}(z)$, we have $|(f \mid_k \gamma) (z) |\le \epsilon$. We call such functions *zero at infinity*.

Although the following examples are not part of this PR, let me include them here so that we can see some interesting examples of modular forms, known as *Eisenstein series*. These are functions defined as $$G_k(z) = \sum_{(c,d) \ne (0,0)} \frac{1}{(cz+d)^k}, \qquad \text{for } c,d \in \mathbb{Z}.$$ For $k \gt 2$ and even these functions are non-zero modular forms of weight $k$ and level $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. 

# Formalised definitions

Lets now look at what this ended up as in mathlib. There we lots of small things that needed doing before getting to these definitions, such as defining $\mathrm{GL}_n$ (and $\mathrm{GL}_n^+$) ([PR# 8466](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/8466))[^0], extending the action of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ on $\mathbb{H}$ to an action of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{R})^+$ ([PR# 12415](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/12415)), defining slash actions ([PR# 15007](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15007)), defining when a function is zero or bounded at infinity ([PR #15009](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/15009)) amongst other things. But these aren't so interesting so lets skip this and more towards something closer to modular forms.

The first useful definition is that of `slash_invariant_forms` which was introduced in [PR# 17677](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/17677) and defines spaces of functions $f : \mathbb{H} \to \mathbb{B}$ which are invariant under the slash action (of some specified weight and level)[^1]. Explicitly the we defined:

```lean
structure slash_invariant_form :=
(to_fun : ‚Ñç ‚Üí ‚ÑÇ)
(slash_action_eq' : ‚àÄ Œ≥ : Œì, to_fun ‚à£[k, Œ≥] = to_fun)

class slash_invariant_form_class extends fun_like F ‚Ñç (Œª _, ‚ÑÇ) :=
(slash_action_eq : ‚àÄ (f : F) (Œ≥ : Œì), (f : ‚Ñç ‚Üí ‚ÑÇ) ‚à£[k, Œ≥] = f)
```

here `Œì` is a subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ and `‚à£[k, Œ≥]` is notation for the weight `k` slash action by `Œ≥`. The idea behind having a structure and a class[^2] is that later, we will define modular forms and cusp forms as extensions of these structures and classes. By doing this (and proving some number of other instances) we can make so that lemmas proven for `slash_invariant_forms` will automatically hold for modular forms and cusp forms (such as [this](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/number_theory/modular_forms/slash_invariant_forms.html#slash_invariant_form.slash_action_eqn')). 

Next we can define modular forms as follows: 

```lean
structure modular_form extends slash_invariant_form Œì k :=
(holo' : mdifferentiable ùìò(‚ÑÇ) ùìò(‚ÑÇ) (to_fun : ‚Ñç ‚Üí ‚ÑÇ))
(bdd_at_infty' : ‚àÄ (A : SL(2, ‚Ñ§)), is_bounded_at_im_infty (to_fun ‚à£[k, A]))

class modular_form_class extends slash_invariant_form_class F Œì k :=
(holo: ‚àÄ f : F, mdifferentiable ùìò(‚ÑÇ) ùìò(‚ÑÇ) (f : ‚Ñç ‚Üí ‚ÑÇ))
(bdd_at_infty : ‚àÄ (f : F) (A : SL(2, ‚Ñ§)), is_bounded_at_im_infty (f ‚à£[k, A]))
```

Here: 
-  `mdifferentiable` enforces that the function is holomorphic (now as a function between complex manifolds $\mathbb{H}$ and $\mathbb{C}$.
-  `is_bounded_at_im_infty` encodes (üê±) above by requiring that $f$ be bounded with respect to the [filter](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/analysis/complex/upper_half_plane/functions_bounded_at_infty.html#upper_half_plane.at_im_infty) "tends to $i\infty$" (`at_im_infty`).[^3]

The definition of cusp forms is the same, except we change `is_bounded_at_im_infty` for `is_zero_at_im_infty`. We then give a long list of instances that these new types satisfy, ending up at:

```lean
instance : module ‚ÑÇ (modular_form Œì k) :=

instance : module ‚ÑÇ (cusp_form Œì k) :=
```

**Remark :** At this point you are allowed to complain that these definitions are not as general as they could be. For example, why restrict the levels to subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$? or why only consider modular forms for $\mathrm{GL}_2$? or why are the weights not allowed to be rational numbers?, etc. These defintions go againts the philosophy of "doing things as generally as possible". In this situation, doing the most general definitions would require us to have more complicated conditions for (üê±)  and (üê∂), or defining more general connected reductive groups over global fields. But as Kevin Buzzard [suggested](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144837-PR-reviews/topic/.2313250.20Modular.20form.20definition/near/303611399), we can reserve the name automorphic form until we  are ready to define these more general objects. Otherwise it would be years until we could talk about Atkin--Lehner theory, multiplicity one, modularity conjectures, etc.

# Whats next?

The very next thing we will PR about modular forms will be the fact that one can define a graded commutative ring of modular forms (i.e. prove a `gcomm_ring` instance). Originally, the definitions for the spaces of modular forms had them as subspaces of the complex vector space of functions $\mathbb{H} \to \mathbb{C}$, which made it relatively straight forward to construct this graded ring (as they were all terms of the same type). With the final form of the defitions one runs into the usual problems that `(modular_form Œì k)` isn't defeq to `(modular_form Œì (k + 0))` (and other similar issues). Meaning that one needs to work a bit harder to give the `gcomm_ring` instance. But with some guidance from Eric Weiser, it is doable (see [PR# 17879](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/17879)). This is also a nice test that our definition is workable.

After this, the next obvious goal is to get some examples into mathlib, meaning Eisenstein series. There is a repo [here](https://github.com/CBirkbeck/ModularForms) which has a proof that Eisenstein series are in fact modular forms. It also contains several other things that should gradually make their way into mathlib (or more likely mathlib4) such a q-expansions, Hecke algebras, Petersson inner products, etc.


[^0]: If you are wondering why we would need this for defining modular forms, the answer is that we will eventually want Hecke operators acting on these spaces, so we need something larger than $mathrm{SL}$.
[^1]: If you add the condition that such functions are also meromorphic you get *weakly modular functions*.
[^2]: The idea of using these structures/classes and `fun_like` was suggested to us by Mortiz Doll and Jireh Loreaux
[^3]: This filter definition of bounded at infinity and zero at infinity was suggested to us by David Loeffler.
